			Keep an eye on what’s playing in last.fm, even when you’re not
			looking. SkronkFM stays out of your way, but is always there
			when you need it. It doesn’t matter if you’re playing music on
			your Mac, on your phone, on a media center in the next room, or
			even across town. As long as your music player can update
			last.fm, your currently playing track will show up on your
			desktop.

			Getting Started:
		</h2>
		<p>
			The first time you start up SkronkFM, it will ask you to enter a
			last.fm account name to watch. Since we’re just looking at
			public last.fm info and not updating anything, you don’t need to
			authenticate with last.fm.
		</p>
		￼ <img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-prompt.png" width="685" height="87" alt="SkronkFM prompting for last.fm user account name" /> 
		<p>
			Enter your last.fm user name in the Preferences window and hit
			the return key. The entry field should already be selected for
			you. If you’re not sure you have the correct user account name,
			you can click the last.fm icon beside the entry field and that
			user’s last.fm page should open in your default browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can take this opportunity to experiment with SkronkFM’s
			settings, or close the Preferences window and get right into it.

		<p>
			SkronkFM should immediately load your current or most recent
			last.fm track. The last.fm icon at the right will flash each
			time SkronkFM updates its status from last.fm.
		</p>
		<img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-opaque.png" width="668" height="64" alt="SkronkFM playing" /> 
		<p>
			If you’re not listening to last.fm right now, SkronkFM will load
			your most recently played track, but gray it out to make it
			clear that it doesn’t see music playing.
		</p>
		<img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-opaque-notplaying.png" width="668" height="64" alt="SkronkFM not playing" /> 
		<p>
			Turn on Transparent Background in Preferences if you want to see
			through to the desktop or other windows behind SkronkFM.
		</p>
		<img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-transparent.png" width="626" height="74" alt="SkronkFM with transparent background" /> 
		<p>
			By default, SkronkFM keeps a constant width, and will truncate
			longer song titles. Turn on Autosize To Fit to shrink and expand
			to perfectly fit the title size. This comes in handy if you have
			a very long track title:
		</p>
		<img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-opaque-long.png" width="1046" height="64" alt="SkronkFM with very long song track title" /> 
		<p>
			If last.fm doesn’t have album info for a given track, it will
			show a placeholder image for the album art. See the FAQ for why
			this might happen. 
		</p>
		<img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-opaque-no-artist.png" width="368" height="74" alt="SkronkFM with no album info" /> 
		<p>
			If you don’t feel like opening up the Preferences window every
			time you need to make a change, you can set most of the same
			options from the optional SkronkFM menu bar.

		<h2>
			FAQ:
		</h2>
		<p>
			I'm listening to music but SkronkFM is not updating. How often
			does SkronkFM check my last.fm playing status? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Every fifteen seconds. Checking it more often typically won't
			result in faster updates, since many of the music services like
			Mog and Rdio don't scrobble songs until they've been playing for
			a certain length, for example 25% completed. Commonly this
			translates into 30-60 seconds into a song before last.fm first
			sees the new song. For longer songs it may take even more time
			to scrobble. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Why does it take each service (Spotify, Mog) so long to update
			my playing status? 
		</p>
		<p>
			See previous answer. Different music services have different
			rules on how often they send last.fm updates. Some scrobbling
			applications may allow you to customize their scrobbling rules. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Why does SkronkFM keep saying my music has stopped? 
		</p>
		<p>
			SkronkFM can only report what last.fm tells it. If a scrobbling
			application or service does not send an update to last.fm after
			restarting a paused song, last.fm will not be able to see that
			the song is playing again. When the next song begins, last.fm
			should get a fresh update. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Where's my album? Where's my album art? 
		</p>
		<p>
			If last.fm doesn't recognize the song you're scrobbling, it
			won't be able to associate it with an album. Sometimes small
			differences in the song name will throw things off, like missing
			punctuation or alternate spellings. When in doubt, look it up on
			last.fm by selecting "Open Song on last.fm" from the SkronkFM
			menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			That flashing icon is distracting. How do I get rid of it? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Turn off the option "Show Music Source" in Preferences or in the
			menu bar menu. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Does SkronkFM update in the background? 
		</p>
		<p>
			SkronkFM only checks the network when it's showing. If you hide
			it, SkronkFM will cease network activity until you show it
			again. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Scrobble? 
		</p>
		<p>
			"Scrobble" is last.fm's term for sending song updates from your
			local playlist to last.fm. 
		</p>
		<p>
			What if I don’t have a question? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Feel free to ask it anyway. Send all your non-questions to
			<a href="mailto:skronk@fourfringe.com">skronk@fourfringe.com</a>.
