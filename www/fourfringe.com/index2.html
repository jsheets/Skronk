          Keep an eye on what's playing in last.fm, even when you're not
          looking. SkronkFM stays out of your way, but is always there

          even across town. As long as your music player can update
          last.fm, your currently playing track will show up on your
          desktop.

            The first time you start up SkronkFM, it will ask you to enter a
            last.fm account name to watch. Since we're just looking at
            public last.fm info and not updating anything, you don't need to
            authenticate with last.fm.
          </p>
          <img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-prompt.png" width="685" height="87" alt="SkronkFM prompting for last.fm user account name" />
          <p>
            Enter your last.fm user name in the Preferences window and hit
            the return key. The entry field should already be selected for
            you. If you're not sure you have the correct user account name,
            you can click the last.fm icon beside the entry field and that
            user's last.fm page should open in your default browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can take this opportunity to experiment with SkronkFM's
            settings, or close the Preferences window and get right into it.

        <h2>Watching Your Music:</h2>
        <div id="watching-music">
          <p>
            SkronkFM should immediately load your current or most recent
            last.fm track. The last.fm icon at the right will flash each
            time SkronkFM updates its status from last.fm.
          </p>
          <img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-opaque.png" width="668" height="64" alt="SkronkFM playing" /> 
          <p>
            If you're not listening to last.fm right now, SkronkFM will load
            your most recently played track, but gray it out to make it
            clear that it doesn't see music playing.
          </p>
          <img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-opaque-notplaying.png" width="668" height="64" alt="SkronkFM not playing" /> 
          <p>
            Turn on Transparent Background in Preferences if you want to see
            through to the desktop or other windows behind SkronkFM.
          </p>
          <img style="border-width: 0px;" src="images/screenshot-transparent.png" width="626" height="74" alt="SkronkFM with transparent background" /> 
          <p>
            By default, SkronkFM keeps a constant width, and will truncate
            longer song titles. Turn on Autosize To Fit to shrink and expand
            to perfectly fit the title size. <!--
This comes in handy if you have
            a very long track title:

          <p>
            If last.fm doesn't have album info for a given track, it will
            show a placeholder image for the album art. See the FAQ for why
            this might happen.

          <p>
            If you don't feel like opening up the Preferences window every
            time you need to make a change, you can set most of the same
            options from the optional SkronkFM menu bar.

        <h2>FAQ:</h2>
        <div id="faq">
          <p class="question">
            I'm listening to music but SkronkFM is not updating. How often
            does SkronkFM check my last.fm playing status? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Every fifteen seconds. Checking it more often typically won't
            result in faster updates, since many of the music services like
            Mog and Rdio don't scrobble songs until they've been playing for
            a certain length, for example 25% completed. Commonly this
            translates into 30-60 seconds into a song before last.fm first
            sees the new song. For longer songs it may take even more time
            to scrobble. 
          </p>

          <p class="question">
            Why does it take each service (Spotify, Mog) so long to update
            my playing status? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            See previous answer. Different music services have different
            rules on how often they send last.fm updates. Some scrobbling
            applications may allow you to customize their scrobbling rules. 
          </p>

          <p class="question">
            Why does SkronkFM keep saying my music has stopped? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            SkronkFM can only report what last.fm tells it. If a scrobbling
            application or service does not send an update to last.fm after
            restarting a paused song, last.fm will not be able to see that
            the song is playing again. When the next song begins, last.fm
            should get a fresh update. 
          </p>

          <p class="question">
            Where's my album? Where's my album art? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            If last.fm doesn't recognize the song you're scrobbling, it
            won't be able to associate it with an album. Sometimes small
            differences in the song name will throw things off, like missing
            punctuation or alternate spellings. When in doubt, look it up on
            last.fm by selecting "Open Song on last.fm" from the SkronkFM
            menu. 
          </p>

          <p class="question">
            That flashing icon is distracting. How do I get rid of it? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Turn off the option "Show Music Source" in Preferences or in the
            menu bar menu. 
          </p>

          <p class="question">
            Does SkronkFM update in the background? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            SkronkFM only checks the network when it's showing. If you hide
            it, SkronkFM will cease network activity until you show it
            again. 
          </p>

          <p class="question">
            Scrobble? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            "Scrobble" is last.fm's term for sending song updates from your
            local playlist to last.fm. 
          </p>

          <p class="question">
            What if I don't have a question? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
