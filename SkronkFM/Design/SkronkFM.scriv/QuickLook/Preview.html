It doesn’t matter if you’re playing music on your Mac, on your phone, on a media center in the next room, or even across town. As long as your music player can update last.fm, your currently playing track will show up on your desktop.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>FAQ</strong><br/>I'm listening to music but SkronkFM is not updating. How often does SkronkFM check my last.fm playing status?<br/>
Every fifteen seconds. Checking it more often typically won't result in faster updates, since many of the music services like Mog and Rdio don't scrobble songs until they've been playing for a certain length, for example 25% completed. Commonly this translates into 30-60 seconds into a song before last.fm first sees the new song. For longer songs it may take even more time to scrobble.<br/>

I previously set up an iTunes Connect account with tax info for an LLC partnership company (Apple ID: mobilemethod, EIN 26-4584272). That company is closing down, and I would like to start selling apps under a different company (Apple ID: john@fourfringe.com, EIN 26-0835223). The two companies have different Federal EINs, but share the same street address (my home address, 11552 Able St NE, Blaine, MN, 55434).<br/>

My banking info is already set up in iTunes Connect for the n...</p>
