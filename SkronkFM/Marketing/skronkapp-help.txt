## GETTING STARTED:

The first time you start up SkronkFM, it will ask you to enter a last.fm account name. Since we’re watching public last.fm info and not updating anything, you don’t need to authenticate with last.fm.

Enter your last.fm user name in the Preferences window and hit the return key. The entry field should already be selected for you. If you’re not sure you have the correct user account name, you can click the last.fm icon beside the entry field and that user’s last.fm page should open in your default browser.

You can take this opportunity to experiment with SkronkFM’s settings, or close the Preferences window and get right into it.

## WATCHING YOUR MUSIC:

SkronkFM should immediately load your current or most recent last.fm track. The last.fm icon at the right will flash each time SkronkFM updates its status from last.fm.

If you’re not listening to last.fm right now, SkronkFM will load your most recently played track, but gray it out to make it clear that it doesn’t see music playing.

Turn on Transparent Background in Preferences if you want to see through to the desktop or other windows behind SkronkFM.

SkronkFM autosizes to fit each track's title. This comes in handy if you have a very long track title:

If last.fm doesn’t have album info for a given track, it will show a placeholder image for the album art. See the FAQ for why this might happen.

If you don’t feel like opening up the Preferences window every time you need to make a change, you can set most of the same options from the optional SkronkFM menu bar.
