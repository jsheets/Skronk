## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does SkronkFM decide which music player to show?

> SkronkFM always prefers locally running music applications over the remote last.fm web service. If no local apps are playing, SkronkFM will then check for songs on last.fm. It doesn't matter if the music apps are running in the background; SkronkFM only registers local apps when they are currently playing music.

### Why doesn't SkronkFM notice when I pause the desktop Mog application?

> Different music applications provide different levels of support for remote control. In the case of the Mog desktop application, Mog.app does not report when a song is paused, only when the next song starts.
> 
> If Mog is paused and you are trying to access your last.fm updates, you can quit Mog.app to remove it from the list that SkronkFM will check.

### I'm listening to music but SkronkFM is not updating. How often does SkronkFM check my last.fm playing status?

> Every fifteen seconds. Checking it more often typically won't result in faster updates, since many of the music services like Mog and Rdio don't scrobble songs until they've been playing for a certain length, for example 25% completed. Commonly this translates into 30-60 seconds into a song before last.fm first sees the new song. For longer songs it may take even more time to scrobble.

> If you're running SkronkFM on the same Mac as your music applications, SkronkFM can talk to them more directly, without going through last.fm. If that's the case, the application's icon should show up in the Skronk window.

### Why does SkronkFM keep saying my music has stopped?

> SkronkFM can only report what last.fm tells it. If a scrobbling application or service does not send an update to last.fm after restarting a paused song, last.fm will not be able to see that the song is playing again. When the next song begins, last.fm should get a fresh update.

### Do I need a last.fm account to use SkronkFM?

> For now, yes. The initial release of SkronkFM uses last.fm as its sole music source. Future versions of SkronkFM will add support for watching additional music players. At that point, last.fm will be optional.

### Where's my album? Where's my album art?

> If last.fm doesn't recognize the song you're scrobbling, it won't be able to associate it with an album. Sometimes small differences in the song name will throw things off, like missing punctuation or alternate spellings. When in doubt, look it up on last.fm by selecting "Open Song on last.fm" from the SkronkFM menu.

### That flashing icon is distracting. How do I get rid of it?

> Turn off the option "Show Watcher Icon" in Preferences or in the menu bar menu.

### Does SkronkFM update in the background?

> SkronkFM only checks the network when it's awake. If you sleep it with the menu or shortcut key, SkronkFM will cease network activity until you wake it again.

### Scrobble?

> "Scrobble" is last.fm's term for sending song updates from your local playlist to last.fm.

### What if I donâ€™t have a question?

> Feel free to ask it anyway. Send all your non-questions to skronk@fourfringe.com.
