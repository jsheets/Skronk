## Watch your music from the comfort of your own desktop.

### *[Now in the Mac App Store!](http://bit.ly/skronkfm_macappstore)*

&nbsp;

Always know which song you're currently playing on [last.fm](http://last.fm/), even when your player isn't visible. No need to keep switching back to your music application to look.

Works great with the [last.fm web player](http://www.last.fm/listen), with [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/), [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/), and [Mog](http://mog.com) on desktop or mobile, and with any other last.fm scrobbling player. It doesn’t matter if you’re playing music on your Mac, on your phone, on a media center in the next room, or even across town. Whatever last.fm sees, SkronkFM sees.
