Always know which song you're currently playing. SkronkFM talks directly to local music player applications like iTunes, [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/), [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/), and [Mog](http://mog.com) for quick and accurate song updates.

Within seconds of each song change, SkronkFM will update to show the current track, artist, and album. To change from one music application to another, simply start playing in the new one. SkronkFM will automatically detect the switch.

It also syncs up with the [last.fm music service](http://www.last.fm/listen) so you can track music from remote sources, including mobile apps, media servers, and web streaming players.
